=== Sound Effects (SFX) ===
If your monster holds any special sound effects, not original from the default library, note that to be played properly by the client it must: 
* Generated, recorded or converted to WAV.
* Be set in a bit rate no superior than 352kbps.

The safest way found to achieve perfect use of the SFX by the client is converting any file using [Audacity](http://www.audacityteam.org/download/) or similar audio editors. Converting the file on popular all-media converters, such as [FormatFactory](https://formatfactory.en.uptodown.com/windows) at default settings will result in a high bit rate, and although it can be played normally by other software, the client is incompatible with it.

For uncompressed formats, such as WAV, the bit-rate (number of binary digits per second) can be calculated from the "sample rate", "sample format" and "number of audio channels".

=== Converting on Audacity ===
* Open or Import desired audio file (such as OGG).
* Select 'Export As' on 'File' menu and save it as WAV.
* Right-click the exported file, check the 'Details' tab bit rate, if it's not above 352 kbps it should work.

=== Converting on FormatFactory ===
* Import or drag the desired audio file to the window.
* Select 'Audio' then 'WAV' and, before clicking 'Ok', hit 'Settings'.
* Change 'Sample Rate' to 22050 and set 'Audio Channel' to 1, hit 'Ok' and click 'Start'.
* Right-click the exported file, check the 'Details' tab bit rate, if it's not above 352 kbps it should work.
