# Mapflag

A Map Flag describes restrictions, properties, and behaviors of a certain map. The map flags alter the behavior of the map regarding teleporting, storing location when disconnected, dead branch usage, penalties upon death, PVP behaviour, WoE behavior, ability to use skills or open up trade deals, current weather effects, and whether day/night will be in effect on this map.

Map flags can be found in the folder. However, some existing map flags do not have their own file in that folder therefore one might be required to create it and add it in using the same format as previous entries. All existing map flags can be found in , prefixed by *mf_*, which is not needed whenever you set it.

Do note that Map Flags are not restricted to the folder, for it can also be defined in any another script as long as that script is loaded into the map server and proper syntax is used.
