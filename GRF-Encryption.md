Preparation
===========
- **[GRF Editor](https://rathena.org/board/files/file/2766-grf-editor/)**, if you're not familiar with this software, it is the best **GRF Management Tool** ever coded.
- The files you want to protect, the encryption is made by file so, there's no need to encrypt the whole GRF.
- Your Hexed must be **2012-04-10** or above, it won't work on **2010 Clients**.
- Decide your **Hexed** filename, it's essential for the encryption to work.

Generating Encryption Key
=========================
**GRF Editor** uses a **Key Encryption Method**, what means that your protection is based on a password.
Choose a password you'll remember or note it somewhere, you won't be able to decrypt your files without it and always save a Backup of the files you'll encrypt.

Password chosen, you'll need to generate the **DLL**, the one that will allow your **Client** to read encrypted files.

Open the **GRF Editor** and navigates on the top menu to **Tools** > **GRF Encryption**, you'll see the window below.
