One of the most common issues during server configurations is setting the max base and job levels. The process involves a 2-part editing--the source code and the configuration files.

## Editing The Source Code

### /src/map/map.h
Open /src/map/map.h and look for this line of code:
`#define MAX_LEVEL 160`

Change **160** to your desired maximum value, i.e.
`#define MAX_LEVEL 1000`

## Compiling The Server
After editing the source code, you must recompile your binaries for the changes to take effect.

## Editing The Configuration and Database Files
### /conf/battle/client.conf
Open /conf/battle/client.conf and look for this line of code:
`max_lv: 99`
and
`aura_lv: 99`

Modify these to your desire values. But take note of the maximum values had in your source. Any value exceeding the supported values will be automatically reverted to **99**.

### /db/(pre-)re/job_exp.txt
Set the final maximum values for the base and job levels. The included file supports up to base level 1000.

Each entry under job_exp.txt is in the format
```
Max Level,Class list,Type (0 - Base Exp / 1 - Job Exp),Exp 1,2,3,...
Example: //Base - Normal and Baby Jobs
         99,0:1:2:3:4:5:6:7:8:9:10:11:12:13:14:15:... = 99 Base level for Normal Jobs and baby Jobs
```
Edit the Max Level values to your desired values. You can also set the maximum Job level under this file. Each entry is labelled accordingly.
